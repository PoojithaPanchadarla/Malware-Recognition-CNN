# Malware Recognition using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

This project involves the development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for recognizing malware using a dataset of malware images.

## Overview

Malware recognition is a critical aspect of cybersecurity. This project focuses on utilizing deep learning, specifically a CNN, to classify malware images. The model is trained on a dataset of malware images to learn patterns and features that distinguish between different types of malware.

## Dataset

Dataset consists of about 8000 malware images.
../input/malimg-dataset9010/dataset_9010/dataset_9010/malimg_dataset/train

## Model Architecture

The CNN architecture used for malware recognition is as follows:

- Convolutional layer with 30 filters and a kernel size of (3, 3) using ReLU activation.
- MaxPooling layer with a pool size of (2, 2).
- Convolutional layer with 15 filters and a kernel size of (3, 3) using ReLU activation.
- MaxPooling layer with a pool size of (2, 2).
- Dropout layer with a dropout rate of 0.25.
- Flatten layer to convert the 2D feature maps to a 1D vector.
- Dense layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation.
- Dropout layer with a dropout rate of 0.5.
- Dense layer with 50 neurons and ReLU activation.
- Output layer with the number of classes and softmax activation.

The model is compiled using categorical crossentropy loss and the Adam optimizer.

## Usage

Testing is done on 30% of the dataset, while training is done on 70% of the dataset.
